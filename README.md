#  ![my-gif](https://i.imgur.com/Kf6c5dM.gif) Welcome to my world!



 If you came here then you are either my instructor, someone I sent my resumee to, or a random person in passing, to which I have to say that is quite impressive. None the less, welcome. Since you're here and since this is my space I am going to tell you a little bit about myself, if you don't care about that just go through my repos [which are currently still being created] And yes this will be a lengthy piece because I like to talk about my journey into the compsci universe.


##  My background story

Once upon a time my parents got me a cute little dell laptop which still holds a special place in my heart (but sadly dead&gone) at the age of 11-12. I took to it very quickly and used it to do all sorts of cool stuff. I wanted to use software that cost hundreds of dollars that I didn't have the money for so then I discovered the world of demonoid.com, thePiratebay and also limewire before it was sadly destroyed. My interests in art, graphic design, and video editing ultimately created the door to which led me into computer science.I also used to have a myspace & gaiaonline account which required some basic codeing skills to make your profile look all pretty. So I was coding before I even knew I was coding. Not from scratch! But I was utilizing html and CSS, not realizing that this was coding. I have just been everywhere that I have been allowed to be, and in return I know alot of random things. Like in middle school, whoever was in charge of IT at the time was not doing their job good because I used to use "shutdown -i" on command prompt to force shutdown other students computers in the computer lab. 
Anywho, It's been a mix of things that stemmed from other interests like anime, the desire to learn graphic design, video editing, how to modify my nintendo wii so I could download all the games I want without paying money using the homebrew channel,, and ultimately I could never have done all those fun and possibly not so legal things if I didn't have an aptitude for computers in general. Fast forward to highschool where I found my calling.. by accident! We took a visual basic course and it was very apparent at the very start that I was far too advanced for the course level presented to our class. And because I had a wonderful teacher who was super excited to help me discover my talents, he made me do different assignments than the other students and dubbed me "the best programmer in the history of salam school" That was it. I guess I have always been pulled in one way or another throughout my childhood. Didn't ever occur to me that I would one day be contributing to the computing world, because I just thought really special smart people do that and no way can I do all that but here I am :D and here we are here together in this wonderful world, floating around in space. 




# My Life Currently & Future Goals!

I am in my final semester of my undergraduate degree in computer science. I did not select a concentraiton and I had a gap in my education. I started in 2014, stopped around 2017 and continued in 2022. My major also switched from computer engineering to computer science. Kind of by force since in my area it was not offered. My inspiration to go back is my two children that happened in the gap of my education. I have a 4 year old and a three year old. At some point I experienced severe trauma (not related to the kids) -- so severe I had to completely rewire myself, but that trauma is the reason why I am able to push through any adversity. Like punch me in the face, stab me, and Im going to *still* get this degree and make it. And I can say that in the process I experienced alot of BULL Schei√üe (look it up it is so fun to say) ... But through that Schei√üe I found air and survived.
My intention is to go for my masters in computerscience Most likely in cyber security. Why cybersecurity? I think I was exposed to so much networking related topics and dabbled on the dark side a little to where I think I am just more adept to that topic. And folks, when I say dabbled on the dark side it just means I barely scratched the surface of the world of malicious and I guess I kind of walked amongst them as a noob unaware of my surroundings in the pirating days of glory. Also because the classes seem to always be more fun to me than others. HOWEVER, I do like the arts, and I can be very creative and I think I would do well in the game dev world, it is something I decided I would self-teach myself because anything artsy, designing, in that aspect I thrive in self-learning so that also narrowed it down for me. And after my masters I am ideally going to get my PhD so I can reach the same level as a teacher who told me to switch majors in 2016 and basically made me feel like I would never make it. But really the motivation for me is that the more I learn the more I realize that I have so much to learn!
